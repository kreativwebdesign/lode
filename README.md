LOD Pipeline for the web.

## What is lode?

lode provides an easy way to use level-of-detail artifacts in web applications.
level-of-details is a technique to render simplified models when the viewer has a bigger distance to a certain object.
Usually these artifacts are generated by the designer or the developer ahead of time and then integrated into the scene manually.
lode generates different levels for a given `glTF` file and permits to use these levels within a given application.

## Sub Projects

This repo contains different sub projects which have a uniform way of using them.
