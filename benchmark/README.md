# Benchmark

The benchmark expects `../demo` project to be running.

The benchmark will automatically run a number of samples, to customize the amount of samples, pass `--iterations=n`.

Interpreting the data is currently wip but the logs give an indication of what is already being tracked.

## Dev
Run `yarn setup` to get up and running and then `yarn start`
**Note**: The `../demo` project needs to be running as well.
