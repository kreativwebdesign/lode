The web platform allows 3D visualizations to be made available to a wide audience. Due to the large number of devices on which such an application can be used, performance optimization is essential. In this work, an option to improve runtime performance is shown by generating multiple levels of details (LOD) of a model and displaying them depending on the distance of the virtual camera. Currently, considerable manual effort is required to generate and deploy such artifacts on the web.

\bigbreak
Different approaches for generating LOD artifacts, as well as their advantages and disadvantages, will be demonstrated.
Algorithms for simplifying polygonal models are analyzed, the chosen algorithm is implemented, and a tool is designed to integrate it into the workflow.

\bigbreak
The result is a tool that seamlessly integrates into the developer's workflow and allows to improve the runtime performance of 3D web applications with little manual effort.
By means of a benchmark it is proven that the use of LOD can improve the runtime performance of specific 3D web applications.
