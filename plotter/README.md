## lode Benchmark Plotter

This module shows the data of the benchmark in a clean way.
Make sure to have run the benchmark beforehand as the plotter will always visualize the last result.

Run `yarn start` to generate `fpsChart.jpg` which can be used in the report.
Run `yarn visualize` to start the visualizer on port 8081.
