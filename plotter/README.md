## lode Benchmark Plotter

This module shows the data of the benchmark in a clean way.
Make sure to have run the benchmark beforehand as the plotter will always visualize the last result. The plotter uses plot.ly to generate the diagrams.

## Usage

Run `yarn start` to generate `fpsChart.jpg` and `downloadChart.jpg` which can be used in the report.

## Dev

For local development run `yarn visualize` to start the visualizer on port 8081.
